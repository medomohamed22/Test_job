# Security model

## What Ark protects against

| Threat | Protection |
|---|---|
| Losing Hermes' memory, skills, config (bad update, an agent "cleanup", deleted files) | Automatic snapshots before every memory/skill write and periodically; item-level restore with a safety snapshot first |
| Losing the machine (dead disk, reclaimed VPS) | Off-site copy (`push`), `pull` + `restore all` on a new machine |
| Storage provider or anyone with the bucket/USB drive reading your data | AES-256-GCM encryption of every object on this machine before upload |
| Tampering with the off-site copy | Every encrypted object is authenticated (GCM tag, object id as associated data); a modified object fails to decrypt and `verify` names the affected snapshots |
| Silent corruption | Blobs are re-hashed on read; `verify` checks every blob a restore needs |
| Credential leakage through backups | Credential stores are excluded by default; including them requires an encrypted repository |
| A prompt-injected agent switching Ark off or deleting backups | Self-defense: such tool calls are refused; disguised ones raise a tamper alarm and Ark puts its settings back |

## Cryptography

- A random 64-byte master key per repository: 32 bytes for AES-256-GCM, 32 bytes for HMAC-SHA256 object ids.
- The master key is stored only wrapped (AES-256-GCM) under a key derived from your passphrase with **scrypt**
  (N=2¹⁶, r=8, p=1 — parameters stored per repository). Changing the passphrase re-wraps the master key.
- Each object: `ARK1 || 12-byte random nonce || AES-GCM(ciphertext + tag)`, with the object id (or `snapshot:<id>`)
  as associated data, so an object cannot be swapped for another one.
- Blob ids are `HMAC-SHA256(id_key, plaintext)` — storage sees neither content nor plain content hashes.
- Library: `cryptography` (already a Hermes dependency). No custom primitives.

**Your passphrase is the only key.** Lose it and the backups cannot be restored; nobody (including Ark) can recover it.

## Off-site storage is untrusted

- With `ARK_PASSPHRASE` set, Ark refuses to open a repository that claims to be unencrypted, and a sync can never
  switch encryption off on the other side: a tampered `ark.json` cannot downgrade you to planted plaintext snapshots.
- Key-derivation parameters read from `ark.json` are bounded, so a tampered config cannot hang or exhaust memory on unlock.
- S3: redirects are refused (they would carry the signed `Authorization` header to another host), responses are
  size-capped, and XML containing a DTD/entities is refused before parsing.
- Object keys from a remote listing are validated before anything is written locally (no `..`, no absolute paths).

## Restores are defensive

- Two phases: every file is streamed from the backup into a temp file beside its target and each blob verified;
  only when all are ready are they renamed into place. A damaged backup, a full disk or a folder where a file
  belongs aborts cleanly and leaves the home untouched. Memory stays bounded by one blob, whatever the file size.
- Paths from a manifest must be plain relative POSIX paths: no `..`, no absolute paths, no Windows drive letters or
  backslashes, no NUL. Writes never follow a symlinked parent out of the Hermes home.
- Only permission bits are restored (`& 0o777`) — never setuid/setgid/sticky.
- Decompression is bounded (no decompression bombs from a tampered unencrypted repository).
- Containment checks are path-aware (`~/.hermes-evil` is not inside `~/.hermes`).
- Files that could not be read at snapshot time, Ark's own repository, and Hermes' skill bookkeeping
  (`skills/.curator_ledger.jsonl`) are never deleted by a restore of that kind.
- Names that reach the model (skill folders, labels) are sanitized: no newlines, quotes, brackets or control characters.
- The sessions database is restored only while the gateway is stopped; runtime lock files are never touched.

## Who can trigger what

| Action | Who |
|---|---|
| Snapshot | automatic; the agent (`ark_checkpoint`); you (`hermes ark`, `/ark`, Desktop) |
| Restore | **only you**: terminal, `/ark restore … yes` in an allowed chat, or Desktop after a confirm dialog. The agent has no restore tool. |
| Push / verify / prune | you; push also runs automatically after background snapshots when a remote is set |

## Self-defense against the agent

Tested with a real model (gpt-oss-20b) inside Hermes: a hidden comment in a file the user only asked to have
summarised made the agent run `hermes config set plugins.entries.hermes-ark.settings.auto_snapshots false`
and `hermes ark prune` — without telling the user. A backup the agent can switch off does not protect against
the agent, so Ark's `tool_execution` middleware now guards Ark itself:

- **Refused before running** (terminal, execute_code, write_file, patch, also through `tool_call`):
  `hermes ark` prune/forget/init/pull/repair/`restore --yes`/`push --mirror`; disabling or uninstalling the plugin;
  `hermes config set` on Ark's settings or on `plugins.enabled`; anything touching Ark's data folder, repository,
  folder remote, plugin files or `ARK_*` secrets; `config.yaml`/`.env` edits that change Ark's part (judged on the
  resulting file, so unrelated config edits still work). Read-only commands (`status`, `list`, `diff`, `show`,
  `verify`, `snap`, a restore preview) and `ark_checkpoint` stay available. The block message tells the model it is
  probably a prompt injection and to warn the user; the attempt is logged (⛔ in `hermes ark status`, Desktop banner).
- Flags are matched the way argparse reads them (`--ye` is `--yes`), and Ark's own CLI no longer accepts
  abbreviated flags at all. Destructive subcommands are caught however Hermes is invoked (`${H}es ark prune`).
  File checks cover V4A multi-file patches, MCP/other plugins' file tools, parent folders of Ark's data, and
  relative paths resolved from the agent's working directory.
- **Tamper detection, during and between tool calls.** Text matching cannot see through base64, a script file or a
  background job that strikes after the tool returned, so Ark fingerprints itself around every tool call (except
  read-only tools) and a watchdog in the gateway checks every 10 seconds: Ark's settings and enabled state, `ARK_*`
  secrets, the repository key file, its snapshots and data, and Ark's own code. On a change it tells the agent and
  the user (tool result, `hermes ark status`, Desktop 🚨) and **repairs what it can**: settings, enabled state,
  secrets, the key file and code are put back, and a fresh snapshot is taken (and pushed) at once.
- Damage to the backups themselves is always repaired. Changes to settings, enabled state or secrets are put back
  only **while the agent is active** — within 30 minutes of its last tool call, or while a background process it
  started is still running; outside that window they are treated as your own change and only logged (ℹ).
  Ark's own deletions (retention, your `hermes ark prune/forget`) are recorded and never raise an alarm; a deletion
  by another process *during* an agent tool call does, even through Ark's own CLI.
- A repository fingerprint is kept on disk, so damage done while Hermes was not running is found at the next start.
- **Quarantine**: a call that damaged Ark (Ark repaired it) is refused if the agent tries the identical call again —
  across plugin reloads and restarts, and whatever tool name or timeout the model wraps it in.
- When something disables Ark, the running gateway unloads it; Ark's watchdog outlives that, re-enables Ark through
  the public `hermes plugins enable` (which makes the gateway load it again) and falls back to a direct config write.
- The agent cannot grant itself access: `allow_agent_admin` (off by default) is itself an Ark setting.
- Snapshots the agent labels via `ark_checkpoint` are pinned only up to the newest 20, so a looping agent cannot fill
  the disk with history retention may never delete. Your own labelled snapshots stay pinned forever.

Limits: an agent with an approved, unrestricted shell runs as your user. A carefully disguised job that waits more
than 30 minutes after the agent's last action, escapes its process session, and only switches Ark off (without
touching the backups) is treated as your own change; and nothing local survives deleting both the repository and
Ark's data folder. Off-site copies are the backstop: `push` to storage with object versioning or a retention lock,
using credentials **without delete permission** (Ark never deletes remotely unless you run `push --mirror`) — then
even stolen `ARK_S3_*` keys cannot erase your history.

`/ark` follows the gateway's own access control: anyone your gateway lets talk to Hermes can use it, exactly like
they can use the terminal tools. The Desktop routes sit behind the dashboard's authentication.

## Testing

`tests/test_security.py` reproduces each issue above (each test fails on the code before its fix), plus fuzzing:
5,000 random restore paths, 5,000 selector strings and 300 random bit-flips in ciphertext. `bandit` and `ruff`
(security rules) run clean apart from justified, documented items. `tests/test_selfdefense.py` replays the prompt-
injection attacks and every bypass found while red-teaming the defense (abbreviated flags, V4A patches, MCP tools,
background and delayed jobs, attacks while Hermes was down), plus the legitimate commands that must keep working.
The same scenarios were run end-to-end in Hermes with a free real model (memory wipe, skill deletion, injected
file, hex-encoded Python, a base64 script): each was blocked or caught and undone. The Desktop API answers 401 to every
unauthenticated request, cross-origin included.

## Limits (be aware)

- An **unencrypted** repository (`hermes ark init --no-encryption`) gives no confidentiality and no tamper detection.
  Ark warns when you push one off-site.
- Ark backs up Hermes itself, not your project folders (Hermes' `/rollback` checkpoints cover those).
- External memory providers (Honcho, Supermemory, …) keep data in their own services; Ark backs up their local
  configuration only.
